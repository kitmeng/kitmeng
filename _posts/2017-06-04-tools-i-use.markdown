Here are a list of my favourite tools to plan and organise my work + life goals.

<span style="color:#026AA7;">**Trello** → </span> I am completely obsessed with this productivity tool. I use Trello for everything, from setting personal life goals, to recording down ✈ travel plans.

**<span style="color:#20a48d;">S</span><span style="color:#40113f;">l</span><span style="color:#e6176f;">a</span><span style="color:#edb524;">c</span><span style="color:#78971f;">k</span>** → Like e-mail on steroids. Besides that, I mostly love the extensions I can add to the main app functionality.(e.g. RSS reader for advertising news)

<span style="color:#F2D600;">**Google Docs** → </span>Perfect for quickly putting together slides to explain your thoughts. Also, I love being able to collaborate with my team members on one single file.

<span style="color:#EE8434;">**Sublime Text** → </span>Yes, I do play around with code from time to time.

<span style="color:#666666;">**GitHub Pages** → </span>Where this website is hosted.

<span style="color:#8dcf3f;">**Siteleaf** → </span>Simple interface, great documentation for newbies of CMSs like me.

<span style="color:#ff4400;">**IFFTT** → </span>Great for automating repetitive tasks.
