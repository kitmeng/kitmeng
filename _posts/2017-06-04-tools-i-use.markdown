Here are a list of my favourite tools to plan and organise my work + life goals.

<span style="color:#026AA7;">**Trello** → </span> I am completely obsessed with this productivity tool. I use Trello for everything, from setting personal life goals, to recording down ✈ travel plans.

**Slack** → Like e-mail on steroids. Besides that, I mostly love the extensions I can add to the main app functionality.(e.g. RSS reader for advertising news)

<span style="color:#F2D600;">**Google Docs** → </span>Perfect for quickly putting together slides to explain your thoughts. Also, I love being able to collaborate with my team members on one single file.

**Sublime Text** → Yes, I do play around with code from time to time.

**Github Pages** → Where this website is hosted.

<span style="color:#8dcf3f;">**Siteleaf** → </span>Simple interface, great documentation for newbies of CMSs like me.

**IFFTT** → Great for automating repetitive tasks.
