Here are a list of my favourite tools to plan and organise my work + life goals.

<span style="color:#026AA7;">**Trello** → </span> I am completely obsessed with this productivity tool. 

**Slack** → Like e-mail on steroids. Besides that, I mostly love the extensions I can add to the main app functionality.(e.g. RSS reader for advertising news)

**Google Docs** → Perfect for quickly putting together slides to explain your thoughts. Also, I love being able to collaborate with my team members on one single file.

**Sublime Text** → Yes, I do play around with code from time to time.

**Github Pages** → Where this website is hosted.

**Siteleaf** → Where

**IFFTT** →
