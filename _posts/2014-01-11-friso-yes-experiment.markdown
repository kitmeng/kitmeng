<!--<div class="box box-purple">Description</div>-->

<p class="textindent">'The Yes Experiment' is a social experiment campaign created to challenge mothers to stop saying 'No' to their children's daily reasonable requests, allowing them to freely discover new experiences. I created concept visuals for the microsite and various social media content to support the campaign.</p>
