<h3>True strength is effortless.</h3>

<p>We were tasked to create interesting, relevant and sharable social content for V-Class, in conjunction with Roger Federer's participation at the 2019 Shanghai ATP Masters.

We came up with the concept of "Roger Federer's 2019 Shanghai Travelogue" in order to highlight V-Class features in an organic way. Within the short span of 10 hours, we captured Roger Federer's unique perspective of immersive Shanghai's rich culture.

We used a first person's perspective method to capture Roger's amazing reactions to his unique Shanghai experience, and also to give viewers a more personal view of the V-Class.</p>
