`Web` `UX` `Concept`

<h3>Communicating MMC's array of features and services in a simple, predictive and human way.</h3>
<p>‘Mercedes me Connect’ are an array of features, services and innovations that provide added value based on the needs and lifestyle of Mercedes-Benz car owners.
</p>

<p>From our research, we found that most Mercedes-Benz car owners do not fully understand the intricacies and full potential of these products and services, and most importantly, how they can be more useful for them in daily life, beyond getting them from A-Z.
</p>

<p>‘The Mercedes me Connect Library’ is an intelligent content system that predicts user’s interests, then showcases relevant content in a human-friendly way.</p>
