<h3>Designing the content platform for the future of driving pleasure</h3>

<p>In a world overcrowded with information, how do we design a progressive and innovative content platform of the future?</p>

<p>The art direction was inspired by how BMW’s vision of Future Driving Pleasure connects the dots of innovation towards a progressive future.</p>

<p>In every design element, transition and animation, we seeked to strike a balance between guided focus and inducing curiosity. Custom made content helped engage the audience and made the experience more immersive.</p>

<p>We took inspiration from familiar user experience patterns (Tik Tok’s personalised content Feed) to intuitively recommend and seamlessly present relevant content to keep our audience engaged.</p>

<p>The result? The content platform of the future.</p>

<h3>'Beyond a Fan' Film</h3>

<p>The story follows how OPPO enables a young FC Barcelona fan to make the ultimate connection with the club he loves. Our hero is a young and shy FC Barcelona fan who has to hide his passion for the club due to his parent's disapproval and lack of understanding. One day, while watching highlights of the latest FC Barcelona match on his OPPO phone, he gets inspired to find an outlet to express this passion.</p>

<p>He decides to start his own fan channel on YouTube. Through the skills he learns off the internet and through the superior creation capabilities of his OPPO phone, he manages to grow his audience and gain a following. Soon, his fan channel becomes a viral sensation.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in a difficult time of FC Barcelona's season, the players manage to chance upon his fan channel. After seeing the fan channel content, they become inspired again and start to perform much better in the next match, with Leo Messi even scoring a hat trick of goals.</p>

<!--ACTIVATION-->
<h3>Oppo X FC Barcelona Official Fan Photographers</h3>

<p>In football matches, only the "pro photographers" are allowed on the field to take official pictures of the beautiful game. However, we believe Oppo phones empower fans to capture the beautiful game in their own unique perspective. The idea here is to engage the fans to become the official fan photographers. Every 30 minutes before every FC Barcelona match starts, we equip fans with Oppo Phones to capture the own take on the "beautiful game".</p>
