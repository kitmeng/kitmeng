`Branding`

<h3>A unified brand identity for a truly global brand</h3>

<p>vivo.com is vivo’s most important platform for online brand image communication and its most important digital marketing channel. However, the site faced several key challenges, most important being a lack of "vivo-ownable" web Brand Identity guidelines.</p>

<p>With the redesign of vivo.com upcoming, our role was to build a new design framework that introduced more breathing room around the content. This became our ‘ownable space,’ where we could bring to life OPPO’s unique design aesthetic.</p>
