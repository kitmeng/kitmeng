**I've never properly explained why I left.**

It was my first time. I traded the comforts of living in my homeland, for  [motherland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing). Not having my mom to pick up after me when I make a mess. Having to pay my own bills. Living alone. All of this is new to me. In spite of this, it was actually a very easy decision to make.

You see, being a sheltered and overprotected 26 year old, and having only about retained the maturity level of an adolescent, I made countless mistakes these past couple of years in the way I treated people who genuinely cared about me. You could say these couple of years have been tumultuous. I had never been so deeply unhappy and disillusioned by life, as if it everything had lost meaning.

I wanted to run away from this life, all that I know. If in other situations I tried to run away from my problems figuratively, this time I  was trying to, *literally*. I thought if I could have a new environment surrounding me, I didn't have to deal with my issues. It didn't take long for me to realise that I couldn't.

While at work, I chanced upon Casey Neistat's TED talk. In it, he showed the audience a promotional video he made for “The Secret Life of Walter Mitty.” The theme of the video was "live your dreams". Instead of making they wanted, he took the studio's money and travel to the Philippines, where a massive Typhoon had hit days earlier. One line from his talk stood out for me, in which he said... (paraphrasing here)

> **"All of us here, we've hit the jackpot in life."**

I realised how lucky I am to have this "average" life. I guess most people would kill to be in my shoes. It kinda shined a light on giving me a purpose of being here. I'm not here to run away from my problems. There is a choice. I can be here to make the most of it. I can be here to\* live my dreams.\*

What is my dream? It's simple really. I wish to not place so much expectations on people and situations to play out how I intend them. I wish to be kind to people, because it's definitely way harder than being mean. I wish to be someone who does more good than harm. It's simple and cliche, but that's my dream. I guess that's the first time I truly discovered how to fill in that void, and right now I'm working towards it everyday.

Here's to many more firsts.
