**It was my first time.** I traded the comforts of living in my homeland, for  [motherland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beijing). Not having my mom to pick up after me when I make a mess. Having to pay my own bills. Living alone. All of this is new to me. However, it was actually a very easy decision to make.

You see, being a sheltered and overprotected 26 year old, and having only about retained the maturity level of an adolescent, I made countless mistakes these past couple of years in the way I treated people who genuinely cared about me. You could say these couple of years have been tumultuous. I had never been so deeply unhappy and disillusioned by life, as if it everything had lost meaning.

Whereas in other situations I ran away from my problems figuratively, this time I tried to *literally*. 

It was an easy decision to make actually.

All this is well and good, but I've been feeling empty sometimes. Lately I've been asking myself what do I want to achieve here?

Perhaps it's a bit selfish, but I wanted adventure.

I've never properly explained why I decided to leave.

I wanted adventure.

Thanks to everyone who thought it was important to make

Here's to many more firsts.
