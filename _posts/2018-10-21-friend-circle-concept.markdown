`Mini Program`

<p>
<div class="font-semibold">THE CHALLENGE</div>
We believe Papa John’s pizza, being communal in nature, has the ability to bring people together. However, keeping track of RSVP lists while setting up a gathering with friends can be a nightmare.

<p>
<div class="font-semibold">THE OUTCOME</div>
That’s where the Papa John’s ‘Friend Circle’ Mini Program comes in handy. This simple tool allows you to easily set up a gathering with friends, keep track of their responses. In addition, it helps figure out which pizza toppings, flavours they prefer.

<strong>A better way to bring friends together.</strong>
