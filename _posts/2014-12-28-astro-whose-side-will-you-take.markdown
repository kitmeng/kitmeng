<p class="textindent">No longer a battle-of-the-bands competition, Unplugged now features 3 days of great workshops and seminars on music ministry development. Come learn from some of the best musicians, vocal trainers and ministry leaders around as they teach lessons on band dynamics, music team building and worship leading.</p>

<p>What’s more, there will also be live worship throughout the conference, plus a Finale Night full of great band performances. And here’s the best part - Finale Night performance slots are open to all bands on a first come first served basis. </p>

<p>The first rebranding in five years since the Inter-Brethren Assemblies' Unplugged band competition first started, and also transitioning from what used to be just a band competition to a music and worship workshop, we decided to overhaul the visual identity to something fresh and much livelier than previous years. Print materials for this year include A3 posters, A4 registration forms and A5 conference booklets.</p>
