`Web` `Concept`

<p>
‘Mercedes me Connect’ are an array of features, services and innovations that provide added value based on the needs and lifestyle of Mercedes-Benz car owners.
</p>

<p>
<div class="font-semibold">THE CHALLENGE</div>
Most car owners do not fully understand the intricacies of these products and services, and most importantly, how what they can be useful for in daily life.
</p>

<p>
<div class="font-semibold">THE OUTCOME</div>
We started off with language. We got rid of complicated technical jargon and introduced each feature with a question of "What if...?". We wanted our target audience to ask more out of their Mercedes-Benz cars. To see this as more than just status symbol that gets them from A-B. Next, we designed a simple, intelligent and predictive web app to house this experience.
