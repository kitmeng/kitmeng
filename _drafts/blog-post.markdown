It was my first time. Trading homeland for motherland. Living alone. This is new for me.

Lately I've been asking myself what do I want to achieve here?

Perhaps it's a bit selfish, but I wanted adventure.

I've never properly explained why I decided to leave.

I wanted adventure.

Thanks to everyone who thought it was important to make

Here's to many more firsts.\
