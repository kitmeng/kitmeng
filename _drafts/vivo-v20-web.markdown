<h3>A fresh take on the prelaunch web experience</h3>
<p>How we helped vivo rethink their prelaunch web experience.</h3>

<h3>Understanding their needs</h3>
<p>V20 is created for fashion forward youth to be in front of the trends. Being in the midst of a branding refresh, vivo wanted a new look and human-centric user experiences to reflect in their prelaunch websites.</p>

<p>The brief was fairly open ended, their requirements were: 1) deliver a friendly and seamless user experience, 2) a visually stand out visually look and feel, and 3) communicate in a way that is relatable and appeals to the audience - fashion forward youth. The work would also later be adapted globally for all overseas markets.</p>

We knew that VICE’s audience likes to read articles, watch videos, and listen to audio content, so we created designs that would maximize access to a variety of different content types and formats while minimizing the effort required to navigate across tons of tabs and pages. Now, the homepage acts as a hub, where users can discover content from across the network—VICE, VICE News, VICELAND—the works.

The homepage provides a daily dose of fresh content, incentivizing viewers to come back each day to see what’s new.

Understanding the VICE vision
VICE is known for its unapologetic take on the news and coverage of underreported stories. Having just given VICE.com a new look to reflect their brand, they wanted the redesign of their mobile experience to follow suit.

The brief was fairly open ended, VICE only had three requirements: 1) discover a way to bring all the VICE entities together in one central hub, 2) give people a way to easily personalize their browsing experience, and 3) find a way to appeal to a younger audience. The work would be showcased at CES to generate excitement for the future of VICE on mobile.


Read, watch, listen

Personalised content selected by you
People like to tailor the content they consume in a way that satisfies their unique interests. Most personalization flows take a passive approach to this, serving a wall of topics to choose from. For VICE, we made the experience more interactive. Readers are encouraged to walk through sample articles on each topic and up-vote or down-vote (via emojis) to curate their feed.

After this initial onboarding, people can continue to interact with the content they’ve selected to help VICE learn more about their browsing preferences and offer up smarter suggestions in the future.

The news, socialised
Think social media is all about selfies and likes? Think again. There’s an entire generation consuming the news via Snapchat and Instagram. To appeal to this younger generation, VICE Stories serves small snippets of shareable, news-related, content featuring VICE influencers and reporters.

Viewers can immerse themselves in the experience with live comments, reactions, and the ability to share with their peers.
