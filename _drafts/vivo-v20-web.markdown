`Web`

<h3>A fresh take on the prelaunch web experience - How we helped vivo rethink their prelaunch web experience.</h3>

<h3>Understanding their needs</h3>
<p>V20 is created for fashion forward youth to be in front of the trends. Being in the midst of a branding refresh, vivo wanted a new look and human-centric user experiences to reflect in their prelaunch websites.</p>

<p>The brief was fairly open ended, their requirements were: 1) deliver a friendly and seamless user experience, 2) a visually stand out visually look and feel, and 3) communicate in a way that is relatable and appeals to the audience - fashion forward youth. The work would also later be adapted globally for all overseas markets.</p>

<h3>The Challenge</h3>
